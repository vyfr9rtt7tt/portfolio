            Iâ€™m a passionate web developer crafting modern, fast, and visually polished websites. I have strong expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, and Sass.

I build responsive and cross-browser user interfaces with clean, maintainable code. I follow a component-based approach, work confidently with React Hooks, routing, external APIs, and use Git/GitHub for version control.

I work on projects of all scales â€” from landing pages and corporate websites to complex platforms like movie and media sites.

ðŸŽ¨ In addition, I independently design websites in Figma, from initial concept to final UI, always focusing on a smooth and thoughtful UX/UI experience.
